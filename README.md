# Disease_Risk_Prediction_System
The Disease Risk Prediction System is an advanced, intelligent web-based platform that harnesses the power of machine learning to analyze comprehensive blood test reports and provide accurate disease risk predictions. This system introduces an innovative approach to preventive healthcare by enabling users to assess potential health risks early and take proactive measures to mitigate them before they escalate into serious conditions. 
This system integrates a sophisticated Random Forest Classifier, a powerful machine learning model that processes essential biomarkers such as blood sugar levels, cholesterol, creatinine, liver enzymes, and thyroid hormone levels. These biomarkers serve as indicators for predicting the likelihood of developing chronic conditions such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, and Thyroid Disorders. 
Developed with Flask as its backend framework and SQLite for database management, the Disease Risk Prediction System ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and processing. The frontend, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides users with an interactive and easy-to-navigate experience. Users can log in securely, input their medical data, receive instant risk assessments, and access expert-recommended health insights for better disease management. 
The fundamental goal of Disease Risk Prediction System is to revolutionize the way individuals approach health risk assessments. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this system enhances diagnostic accuracy, reducing dependency on conventional methods that often involve extensive wait times and manual assessments. Moreover, robust security protocols, including authentication and encryption, safeguard user data and privacy, ensuring confidentiality and trustworthiness.
